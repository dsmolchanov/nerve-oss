# Repository blocking invariants

This file is **owned by this repository**. `plaintalk-dev-agent` installs it once
and never overwrites it, so anything added here survives every fleet-wide policy
refresh.

The fleet-wide invariants live in the `dev-agent:policy` managed block in
`AGENTS.md` and are replaced wholesale on each refresh — do not add
repository-specific entries there, they will be deleted.

## How to use this file

Add an entry when a P1 class keeps coming back; `AGENTS.md`, "Fix the invariant,
not the instance", says at what point. A repeated finding is
a missing rule, not a new discovery: semantic review is an expensive way to
rediscover the same defect, and each round costs a full review generation.

Per the fleet policy, the commit that fixes a recurring P1 should also add the
deterministic check that would have caught it — a lint rule, a test, or a
migration assertion. This list is the human-readable index of those rules, not a
replacement for them.

Each entry should be a closed question a reviewer can answer yes or no. "No route
without an auth dependency" is checkable; "input should be validated" is not, and
an open-ended predicate is satisfiable on any non-trivial diff, which is what
makes a review loop unable to terminate.

## Invariants

<!-- Add entries below. Example shape:

- No handler under `apps/api/routes/` may be registered without a
  `Depends(require_tenant)` argument. Enforced by `tests/test_route_auth.py`.

-->

- MCP conformance checkout overrides must be canonical absolute paths before
  they are passed to a Go package test, whose working directory differs from
  the repository root. Enforced by
  `scripts/ci/test_mcp_conformance_paths.sh`.
- After an onboarding lifecycle mutation (`Start`, `VerifyDomain`, or `Close`)
  may have reached the control plane, does every transport, body-read,
  protocol, or semantically invalid-envelope failure that is not a validated
  durable result or business error return `ErrOnboardingOutcomeUnknown`?
  `Status` is the intentional read-only exception for protocol diagnostics.
  Enforced by the table-driven
  `TestClientResponseBodyTimeoutReturnsOutcomeUnknownForEveryOperation`,
  `TestClientTransportDisconnectReturnsOutcomeUnknownForEveryOperation`,
  `TestClientInvalidPostCommitResponseReturnsOutcomeUnknownForEveryMutation`,
  and `TestClientRejectsSemanticallyInvalidEnvelopesForEveryOperation` tests in
  `internal/onboarding/client_test.go`.
- Do all inbox address lookup, receiving resolution, create, ensure, and
  reactivate paths use the one canonical-equivalence rule, prefer a single
  active row before disabled history where replay is supported, fail closed on
  ambiguity within that selected tier, serialize canonical-variant writers,
  preserve stored legacy bytes, and canonicalize those bytes before outbound
  policy comparison or sender emission? Enforced by
  `TestCanonicalInboxAddressSQLMatchesGoCanonicalization`,
  `TestLegacyCanonicalInboxAddressMatrix`,
  `TestCanonicalInboxDisabledHistorySemantics`,
  `TestInboxInsertHelpersRequireTransaction`,
  `TestCanonicalInboxAddressBoundariesRejectAmbiguousLegacyRows`,
